This repository is an archived version of a group project presenting an interactive web application designed to help 8th grade students choose a high school in Mińsk Mazowiecki.  

The application features an interactive map displaying high schools along with detailed information about each institution, including descriptions and key data.  
It also presents public transport stops and route visualization, allowing students to better understand commuting options and distances.  
The goal of the project was to combine geographic data with practical school information to support informed decision-making.
